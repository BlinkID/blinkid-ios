# Release notes

## 4.0.0

- new API, which is not backward compatible. Please check [README](README.md) and updated demo applications for more information, but the gist of it is:
    - `PPScanningViewController` has been renamed to `MBRecognizerRunnerViewController` and `MBCoordinator` to `MBRecognizerRunner`
    - `PPBarcodeOverlayViewController` has been renamed to `MBBarcodeOverlayViewController`
    - previously internal `MBRecognizer` objects are not internal anymore - instead of having opaque `MBRecognizerSettings` and `MBRecognizerResult` objects, you now have stateful `MBRecognizer` object that contains its `MBResult` within and mutates it while performing recognition. For more information, see [README](README.md) and updated demo applications
    - introduced `MBFieldByFieldOverlayViewController` that can be used for easy integration of the _field-by-field scanning_ feature (previously known as _segment scan_)
    - introduced `MBDocumentVerificationController` that can be used for easy integration of _ID verification scanning_ feature (previously available only in [BlinkID AppStore app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blinkid/id1258136557?mt=8)
    - introduced `MBProcessor` concept. For more information, check updated code samples, [README](README.md) and [this blog post](https://microblink.com/blog/major-change-of-the-api-and-in-the-license-key-formats)

- iOS updates:
    
    - PPOverlayViewController changed the way Overlay Subviews are added to the view hierarchy. Instead of calling `addOverlaySubview:` (which automatically added a view to view hierarachy), you now need to call `registerOverlaySubview:` (which registers subview for scanning events), and manually add subview to view hierarchy using `addSubview:` method. This change gives you more flexibility for adding views and managing autolayout and autoresizing masks.

    - Localization Macros MB_LOCALIZED and MB_LOCALIZED_FORMAT can now be overriden in your app to provide completely custom localization mechanisms.
    
    - Dramatically increased OCR engine initialization speed

    - Increased speed of scanning cancellation when Cancel button is pressed.
    
- ID scanning improvements

    - Added EUDL recognizer (replaced UKDL recognizer). EUDL is capable of automatically detecting various EU Drivers licenses. Currently it works only on German and UK DLs.
    - Fixed issue with 0 and O misclassifications in MRTD recognition
    - Added support for Austrian MRTD ID documents

- Internal changes:

    - Implementeded Templating API for easier implementation of new document types
    - Implemented Face detection
    - Implemented support for Eastern Arabic numeral characters

## 1.3.0

- Added better integration for Swift

    - Added Nullability Attributes
    - Added modulemap file
    - Added sample app in Swift
        
- Added recognizers for scanning barcodes

    - for scanning PDF417 barcodes, use PPPdf417Recognizer
    - for scanning Code128 and Code39 barcodes, use PPBarDecoderRecognizer
    - for scanning QR codes, and other barcode types, use PPZxingRecognizer
        
- Refactored `PPMetadataSettings` 

    - Added debug metadata settings for debugging payslip detection and image processing
    - `successfulScanFrame` renamed to `successfulFrame`
    - `currentVideoFrame` renamed to `currentFrame`
    
- Exposed `PPModernViewfinderOverlaySubview` overlay subview class in public headers. This enables you to more easily recreate default overlay UI in your custom Overlay view controllers.

- Added *Detector API*, a completely new feature which enables you to detect various document types on images. Detector API allows two types of document detections

    - MRTD detection (based on OCR line detection, for MRTD documents like passports, visas, ...)
    - Document Detection (based on edge detection, for ID cards, plastic cards, credit cards, ...)
    
- in `PPCoordinator`, renamed method `isScanningUnsupported:` to `isScanningUnsupportedForCameraType:error:`. This was introduced to provide more granularity in checking if scanning is supported.

- Fixed issues in obtaining images in scanning, most notably in MyKad scanning.

- Fixed issues with Direct API processing of UIImages in some orientations

- Fixed issues with scanning MRZ lines on arm7 devices.

## 1.2.0

- Added recognition of Malysian ID cards (MyKads). To use MyKad recognition initialize the scanning library using `PPMyKadRecognizerSettings`

- Improvements in UK drivers license recognition. BlinkID is now tested on many more UKDL samples and yields much higher recognition rate.

- Improvements in MRTD recognition. Errors such as '0' and 'O' confusions should no longer happen. Improved MRTD document detection algorithm, which now makes old "fixed" recognition redundant. Because of that, the feature to define `mrtdRoi` is now removed.

- Added feature to obtain cropped and trimmed image of the whole MRTD document.

- Fixed several issues in USDL parsing
        - implemented special cases for barcodes which don't have keys according to the AAMVA version written in the barcode
        - implemented heuristics for extraction of firstName, middleName, lastName, address, and other fields, if they can be determined based on the other fields.

- Bugfixes and tweaks in camera management code
        - fixed potential deadlock when multiple instances of `PPCoordinator` objects are instantiated.
        - exiting from the scanning when user presses "cancel" button is now faster

- Renamed `PPUkdlRecognizerResult`'s property `ownerAdress` to `ownerAddress` (fixed typo)

## 1.1.0

- `PPMrtdRecognizerSettings` now sets `detectMachineReadableZonePosition` to YES by default. This means MRZ detection will work by default, meaning you no longer need to position the ID card precisely inside the frame shown in the UI.

- Added full support for parsing MRTD documents according to [ICAO Document 9303](http://www.icao.int/Security/mrtd/pages/Document9303.aspx) standard)

- Added support for scanning VISAs, and Belgian ID documents.

- `PPMrtdRecognizerSettings` now has a new settings `allowUnparsedResults` (default: NO), which you can use to get raw OCR results of the MRZ text, even if BlinkID parsing didn't manage to parse the text (this can happen since MRZ isn't always formatted according to [ICAO Document 9303](http://www.icao.int/Security/mrtd/pages/Document9303.aspx) standard)

    - When YES, `MrtdRecognizerResult` will be returned with `isParsed` property set to NO, and with `rawOcrLayout` property set to the `PPOcrLayout` object which was the result of the OCR process.

    - You should be careful when this property is set to YES, since obtained `OcrLayout` can contain OCR errors (for example (0 <-> O, 2 <-> Z, etc.). If you set this to YES, then you need to perform your own parsing and error correction.

    - If you set this to YES, we suggest the following approach in your result callback
         - obtain mrtdResult
         - if [mrtdResult isParsed]
             - present result and return
        - else if mrtdResult can be parsed with your custom parsing algorithm
             - present your custom results and return
        - else continue scanning since MRTD result cannot be parsed at all

- Improved video frame quality detection: now only the sharpest and the most focused frames are being processed. This improves quality of the results, but at a slight expense of processing time

- Frame quality estimation can now be enabled using `PPScanSettings frameQualityEstimationMode` property:
    - when set to `PPFrameQualityEstimationModeOn`, frame quality estimation is always enabled
    - when set to `PPFrameQualityEstimationModeOff`, frame quality estimation is always disabled
    - when set to `PPFrameQualityEstimationModeDefault`, frame quality estimation is enabled internally, if the SDK determines it makes sense

- iOS 9 introduced new app multitasking features Split View and Slide Over. When the scanner is on screen and one of those features are used, iOS automatically pauses the Camera (this behaviour is default as of iOS 9 beta 5). This SDK version introduces new setting in `PPUISettings` class, called `cameraPausedView`, where you can define the `UIView` which is presented centered on screen when this happens.

- Known issue on iOS 9: if you use Autorotate overlay feature (`settings.uiSetttings.autorotateOverlay`), present `PPScanningViewController` as a modal view controller, and support Split View iOS 9 feature, then autorotation of camera overlays isn't correct. The best way is to opt-out of Split View feature, and wait for SDK fix when iOS 9 comes out of beta.

- `PPScanningViewController` methods `pauseScanning`, `isScanningPaused`, and `resumeScanningAndResetState:` should now be called only from Main thread, and they are effective immediately. E.g., if `pauseScanning` is called and there is a video frame being processed, result of processing of that frame will be discarded, if `resumeScanningAndResetState:` isn't called in the meantime.

- Added support for `PPCameraPresetPhoto` camera preset. Use this if you need the same zoom level as in iOS Camera app. The resolution for video feed when using this preset is the same as devices screen resolution.

## 1.0.1

- Added support for several new special cases of US Driver Licenses in USDL recognizer. 

- Disabled Bitcode in Sample apps so that they are buildable with XCode 7 (Bitcode support in the framework coming soon!)

- Added library dependencies in podspec without which the app after integration couldn't be built 

## 1.0.0

- Changes in Direct processing API
    - You are no longer required to call `PPCoordinator initializeRecognizers` and `PPCoordinator terminateRecognizers`.
    - Instead, `initializeRecognizers` is called lazily on first call of `processImage` method. 
    - `terminateRecognizers` is called automatically in `PPCoordinator` destructor 
    
- Added support for autorotation of `PPScanningViewController`. To support autorotation, use `PPScanningViewController`'s new properties `autorotate` and `supportedOrientations`

- Added `didOutputMetadata:` callback method to `PPOverlayViewControllers`

- Fixed bug which caused Overlay events to be called when direct API is used. Direct API now only reports events to `PPScanDelegate` instance.

- Fixed bug which caused image property of `PPImageMetadata` not take the image orientation into account

- `PPMetadataSettings` cleanup

- `PPApp` class no longer part of public API

## 0.9.6

- US passport scanning now has less confusions between characters 0 and O
- Fixes for French passport format
- Fixed timeout bug which manifested between consecutive scans

## 0.9.5

- Added Direct processing API

## 0.9.4

- Added support for defining region for scaninng in `PPMrtdRecognizerSettings`

- For example, with this code you can specify bottom 25% of the image will be used for MRZ scanning.

```objective-c
PPMrtdRecognizerSettings *mrtdSettings = [[PPMrtdRecognizerSettings alloc] init];
mrtdSettings.mrtdRoi = CGRectMake(0.0, 0.75, 1.0, 0.25);
[settings.scanSettings addRecognizerSettings:mrtdSettings];
```
        
        
## 0.9.3

- Added support for scanning UK Driver's license. To scan them, add PPUkdlRecognizerSettings to `settings.scanSettings`

```objective-c
[settings.scanSettings addRecognizerSettings:[[PPUkdlRecognizerSettings alloc] init]];
```

- To collect UKDL results, look for `PPUkdlRecognizerResult` object in `scanningViewController:didOutputResults:` callback

```objective-c
for (PPRecognizerResult *result in results) {
        if ([result isKindOfClass:[PPUkdlRecognizerResult class]]) {
                PPUkdlRecognizerResult* ukdlResult = (PPUkdlRecognizerResult*)result;
                [self processUkdlResult:ukdlResult scanningViewController:scanningViewController];
        }
}
```
        
- License key format is now changed. If you use license keys generated pior to this version, please contact us so we can generate you a new license key

- Methods and properties in `PPCoordinator` class which were not meant to be part of the public API are now hidden.

## 0.9.2

- Naming changes in API (see Transition guide)
	- `PPBaseResult` renamed to `PPRecognizerResult`
	- `PPBaseResult` subclasses renamed accordingly
	- `PPOcrResult` renamed to `PPOcrLayout`

- Each `PPRecognizerResult` now has implemented `description` method for easier debugging

- Fixed orientation handling for case when overlay autorotates.

- Scanning region is now a property of Scanning view controller, and overlay view controller now delegates to this property.

## 0.9.1

- API consolidation, Bugfixes and improvements

## 0.9.0

- Initial documentation added
	
## 0.6.0

- Initial USDL and MRZ scanning
