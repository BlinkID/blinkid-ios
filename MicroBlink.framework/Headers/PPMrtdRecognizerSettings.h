/**
 * Settings class for configuring MRTD Recognizer.

 * MRTD Recognizer recognizer is used for scanning and parsing Machine readable travel documents.
 * Typical MRTDs are passports, visas, ID cards. They can be recognized by two or three lines of monospace text, which contains all personal
 * information.

 * @see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine-readable_passport

 * @see http://www.icao.int/Security/mrtd/pages/Document9303.aspx
 *
 * When YES, MrtdRecognizerResult will be returned with isParsed property set to NO, and with rawOcrLayout property set
 * to the PPOcrLayout object which was the result of the OCR process.
 *
 * However, you should be careful when this property is set to YES, since obtained OcrLayout can contain OCR errors (for example
 * (0 <-> O, 2 <-> Z, etc.). If you set this to YES, then you need to perform your own parsing and error correction.
 *
 * If you set this to YES, we suggest the following approach in your result callback
 *
 *    - obtain mrtdResult
 *    - if [mrtdResult isParsed]
 *        - present result and return
 *    - else if mrtdResult can be parsed with your custom parsing algorithm
 *        - present your custom results and return
 *    - else continue scanning since MRTD result cannot be parsed at all

 * Also, MRTD recognizer will dewarp and crop the image around the MRTD.
 *
 * This is useful if you're at the same time obtaining Dewarped image metadata, since it allows you to obtain dewarped and cropped
 * images of MRTD documents. Dewarped images are returned to scanningViewController:didOutputMetadata: callback,
 * as PPImageMetadata objects with name @"MRTD"
 *
 * If NO, this logic is not performed.
 *
 * Default: NO.
